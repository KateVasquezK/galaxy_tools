This tool is one of the PlantTribes collection of automated modular analysis pipelines for comparative and evolutionary
analyses of genome-scale gene families and transcriptomes. This tool analyzes scaffolds installed into Galaxy by the
PlantTribes Scaffolds Downloader data manager tool and inserts information about them into the Galaxy PlantTribes database
for querying and additional analysis.

-----

**Required options**

 * **Gene family scaffold** - one of the PlantTribes gene family scaffolds, installed into Galaxy by the PlantTribes Scaffold Data Manager tool, that has not yet been analyzed and loaded into the Galaxy PlantTribes database.
